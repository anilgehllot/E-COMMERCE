Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend 🚀
With Milestone 3 complete, we have successfully set up the backend for our e-commerce application, integrating a server, database connection, and basic error handling. This milestone builds the foundation for handling API requests and managing data efficiently.

What Was Achieved in This Milestone 🎯
1. Backend Folder Structure
We established a clear and organized folder structure for the backend code, making it easier to manage and scale as the project grows:

project-root/
├── backend/
│   ├── routes/         # Defines API routes
│   ├── controllers/    # Contains route handling logic
│   ├── models/         # Defines MongoDB schemas using Mongoose
│   ├── middlewares/    # Includes middleware for error handling
│   ├── config/         # Stores database configuration
│   ├── utils/          # (Optional) Helper functions
│   └── server.js       # Main server file
└── frontend/           # Frontend-related code
2. Server Setup
We configured a Node.js server using Express to handle incoming API requests. The server listens on a designated port and includes:

Middleware for parsing JSON requests.
A root route (GET /) to confirm that the server is running.
Example:

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Server is running!');
});
3. Database Integration
The backend was successfully connected to MongoDB using the Mongoose library:

A .env file was added to store sensitive data like the MONGO_URI.
MongoDB connection established with proper error handling.
Example:

mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
    .then(() => console.log('Connected to MongoDB'))
    .catch((err) => console.error('MongoDB connection failed:', err));
4. Error Handling
We implemented basic error-handling middleware to provide clear error messages and ensure smoother debugging. For unsupported routes, we added a 404 handler.

Example:

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    res.status(404).json({ error: 'Route not found' });
});
Key Commands Used 🛠️
Initialize the Backend Folder:

mkdir backend
cd backend
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose dotenv
Run the Server:

node server.js
Test the API:

Use tools like Postman or curl to test endpoints.
Example: GET http://localhost:5000/
Project Structure Setup:

The project directory was organized into separate frontend and backend folders to maintain a clean and scalable structure. Frontend Setup:

A React application was initialized in the frontend folder using create-react-app, providing a solid foundation for building the user interface. Tailwind CSS was configured to style the frontend with utility-first, responsive styles, ensuring a modern and customizable design approach. Backend Setup:

A basic Node.js server was set up in the backend folder using Express, laying the groundwork for API integrations in future milestones. nodemon was installed and configured to automatically restart the server on code changes for a smoother development experience. Login Page Development:

A Login Page was created in React to allow users to authenticate with the system. The page includes: Email and password input fields. A styled submit button. Basic form handling using React hooks for managing input values and form submission. Tailwind CSS was used to style the Login Page, making it responsive and visually appealing. Deployment Preparation:

Initial steps for deploying the frontend app using GitHub Pages were set up, including the installation of gh-pages and configuration of the necessary deployment scripts.

Milestone 4: Creating User Model and Controller 🌟
In this milestone, we built on the foundation laid in Milestone 3 by creating a User Model for MongoDB, implementing a User Controller to handle user-related actions, and integrating Multer to enable file uploads (e.g., profile pictures).

What Was Achieved in This Milestone 🎯
1. User Model
We created a User model to define the structure of user-related data stored in the MongoDB database. The model includes fields for:

name (string, required)
email (string, required, unique)
password (string, required)
profilePicture (string, optional)
The schema was created using Mongoose.

Example:

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: { type: String, required: true },
    email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
    password: { type: String, required: true },
    profilePicture: { type: String },
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
2. User Controller
We implemented a UserController to manage user-related operations, including:

Create User: Handles the addition of new users to the database.
Get User by ID: Retrieves user details using the user ID.
Update User: Updates user details, including their profile picture.
Example snippet for creating a new user:

const User = require('../models/User');

exports.createUser = async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const { name, email, password } = req.body;
        const newUser = await User.create({ name, email, password });
        res.status(201).json({ message: 'User created successfully', user: newUser });
    } catch (err) {
        res.status(400).json({ error: err.message });
    }
};
3. File Uploads with Multer
We integrated Multer to enable users to upload files, such as profile pictures. Uploaded files are stored in a designated folder on the server.

Multer configuration:
const multer = require('multer');
const path = require('path');

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: (req, file, cb) => {
        cb(null, 'uploads/');
    },
    filename: (req, file, cb) => {
        cb(null, ${Date.now()}-${file.originalname});
    },
});

const upload = multer({ storage });
module.exports = upload;
Example route for uploading a profile picture:
const upload = require('../middlewares/multer');
const UserController = require('../controllers/UserController');

router.post('/upload-profile', upload.single('profilePicture'), UserController.uploadProfilePicture);
4. Updated Folder Structure
The backend folder structure now includes:

backend/
├── routes/
│   └── userRoutes.js    # Defines user-related API routes
├── controllers/
│   └── UserController.js # Handles user logic
├── models/
│   └── User.js          # Defines User schema
├── middlewares/
│   └── multer.js        # Multer configuration
├── uploads/             # Stores uploaded files
└── server.js            # Main server file
Key Commands Used 🛠️
Install Multer and Mongoose:

npm install multer mongoose
Run the Server:

node server.js
How to Test
Create a User:

Use Postman or curl to send a POST request to /api/users with user data (e.g., name, email, password).
Upload Profile Picture:

Send a POST request to /api/users/upload-profile with a file attached as profilePicture.
Milestone 5: Building the Sign-Up Page
In this milestone, I focused on creating the frontend Sign-Up Page for the E-commerce application and implemented form validation to ensure smooth user interaction and data integrity.

Key Accomplishments:
Sign-Up Page Design:

Developed a clean and user-friendly UI using HTML and CSS.
Included fields for Name, Email, and Password.
Form Validation:

Ensured that email addresses follow a valid format (e.g., example@domain.com).
Added password validation to meet minimum security criteria, such as length and complexity.
Provided error messages for invalid inputs.
Responsive Design:

The Sign-Up Page is responsive and works well across different devices.
Challenges Faced:
Debugging input validation logic for edge cases.
Ensuring compatibility with different browsers.
Milestone 6: Backend Endpoint for Secure Signup 🚀
Overview
In this milestone, we focused on creating a secure backend endpoint for the Signup page. This involved encrypting user passwords and securely storing user data in the database.

Features Implemented
Password Encryption:

Used bcrypt to hash user passwords during the signup process.
Ensured only the hashed password is stored in the database, protecting user data from potential breaches.
User Data Storage:

Designed a schema to store user details, including:
Name
Email
Password (hashed)
Additional relevant fields as required.
Ensured proper validation and error handling during the signup process.
Technologies Used
Node.js for backend logic.
Express.js for building the API endpoint.
bcrypt for password hashing.
MongoDB as the database to store user data.
How It Works
Users submit their details through the signup form.
The backend API hashes the password using bcrypt.
The hashed password, along with other user details, is stored in the MongoDB database.

Milestone 7: Create a Backend Endpoint for User Login
Welcome, Kalvians! 🌟
In this milestone, we will create a backend endpoint to handle user login by validating credentials and verifying encrypted passwords stored in the database. Let's dive in!

Learning Goals 🎯
By the end of this milestone, you will:

Understand how to validate user credentials during login.
Learn how to compare an encrypted password with the user's input.
Why Encrypt Passwords?
Protect User Data
Keeps passwords safe even if the database is compromised.

Privacy
Ensures passwords are not stored in plain text.

Compliance
Meets security standards like GDPR and PCI-DSS.

Prevents Password Theft
Hashed passwords are difficult to decipher, increasing security.

How Login Authentication Works 🔑
1. User Enters Credentials
The user provides their email/username and password on the login page.

2. Fetch User Data from Database
The backend retrieves the user record based on the provided email/username.
If the user is not found, return an error: "User does not exist."
3. Compare Encrypted Passwords
Process the user's input password using the same hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
Compare the resulting hash to the stored hashed password.
If they match, the user is authenticated; otherwise, send an error.
Steps for Milestone 7 📝
1. Create Login Endpoint
Accept user credentials (email/username and password) through a POST request.
Retrieve the corresponding user from the database.
2. Validate Password
Use bcrypt to hash the entered password.
Compare it with the stored hashed password to authenticate the user.
Note: Password hashing is a one-way process. Instead of decrypting, we compare hashes.

Example Code
Backend Endpoint
const express = require('express');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const User = require('../models/User'); // Import your User model

const router = express.Router();

// Login Endpoint
router.post('/login', async (req, res) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;

  try {
    // Check if user exists
    const user = await User.findOne({ email });
    if (!user) {
      return res.status(404).json({ message: 'User does not exist' });
    }

    // Compare hashed passwords
    const isPasswordValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);
    if (!isPasswordValid) {
      return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid credentials' });
    }

    // Authentication successful
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Login successful', user: { email: user.email } });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Server error', error });
  }
});

module.exports = router;
